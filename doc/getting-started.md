# when™ `v1.0.0`

## Overview

* Wanted some functional programming in Dart?
* Realised that the only way not to use ifs and switches is ternary operatiors?

## How to use this super-awesome super-helpful super-non-flutter-way library©

1. Define `when™` statement
```
final myWhenStatement = when<int, String>({
  (v) => v == 1: (_) => "a",
  (v) => v == 2: (_) => "b",
  (v) => v == 2: (_) => "c",
  (v) => v == 4: (_) => "d",
  (v) => true: (_) => "you're a failure"
});
```
2. Be aware!
```
final myWhenStatement = when<int, String>({
  (v) => v == 1: (_) => "a",
  (v) => v == 2: (_) => "b", // This one will work
  (v) => v == 2: (_) => "c", // This one will never be handled
  (v) => v == 4: (_) => "d",
  (v) => true: (_) => "you're a failure" // if your value is not handled if previous parts
                                         // you should define else statement
});
```
3. **Call it!**
```
print("out: ${myWhenStatement(1)}") // out: a
print("out: ${myWhenStatement(2)}") // out: b
print("out: ${myWhenStatement(10000)}") // out: you're a failure

//This won't compile
print("out: ${myWhenStatement('-1.0')}")
```
